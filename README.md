# Final Project - Bullhorn Plus
## BLogify

## Your application must include ALL of the  Bullhorn features and ONE feature of your choice from below:

1. Direct Messages: Allow Direct Messages between users. So if Dave sends a direct message to Melissa then Melissa will see a link on her home page. This isn't as hard as it sounds. Remember you have a database to store information so a good time to check for messages is when each user logs in.
2. Followers: Allow users to Follow other Users. That means that if Dave is following Josemy then Dave will see Josemy's posts in his feed along with his own. You can follow people but not unfollow them.
3. Comments: Allow users to make comments on others posts. Users can also reply to comments.
4 .Hashtags: Allow users to add hashtags to their posts. Each hashtag should show up as a link in the post and when clicked will return all posts with that hashtag.
